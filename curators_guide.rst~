   - for curation advice mail `registry-support <mailto:registry-support@elixir-dk.org>`_

  
bio.tools includes all types of bioinformatics *tools* - application software with well-defined data processing functions (inputs, outputs and operations).  This ranges from simple tools with a single primary function, to complex, multimodal tools with many disinct functions.  Tools may be available for immediate use as online services, or in a form which you can download, install, configure and run yourself.

Usually, a bio.tools entry describes a discrete tool.  Some entries describe *collections* of tools, such as software suites.  The scope, *i.e.* the types of tools that may be included, and the attributes for their description, are defined in `biotoolsSchema <https://github.com/bio-tools/biotoolsschema>`_ which uses the `EDAM ontology <https://github.com/edamontology/edamontology/>`_ as a source of terms for the tool scientific description.  These curation guidelines describe how to create a high quality tool description, above and beyond the syntactic and semantic constraints that are defined in biotoolsSchema and EDAM.

- `general guidelines <http://biotools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/curators_guide.html#general-guidelines>`_ include basic considerations, annotation of `tool functions <http://biotools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/curators_guide.html#id12>`_ and the use of `EDAM <http://biotools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/curators_guide.html#id100>`_.  You should read these first of all.
- guidelines on `specific attributes <http://biotools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/curators_guide.html#summary>`_ defined in the `biotoolsSchema <https://github.com/bio-tools/biotoolsschema>`_ 
- guidelines specific to individual `types of tools <http://biotools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/curators_guide.html#guidelines-per-tool-type>`_


The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in `RFC 2119 <http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt>`_:

- **"MUST"**, **"REQUIRED"** or **"SHALL"** mean that the guideline is an absolute requirement of the specification.
- **"MUST NOT"** or **"SHALL NOT"** mean that the guideline is an absolute prohibition of the specification.
- **"SHOULD"** or **"RECOMMENDED"** mean that there may exist valid reasons in particular circumstances to ignore a particular guideline, but the full implications must be understood and carefully weighed before doing so.
- **"SHOULD NOT"** or the phrase **"NOT RECOMMENDED"** mean that there may exist valid reasons in particular circumstances when acting contrary to the geuideline is acceptable or even useful, but the full implications should be understood and the case carefully weighed before doing so.
- **"MAY** or **"OPTIONAL"** mean that the guideline is truly optional; you can choose to follow it or not.
    
.. note::
   
   The guidelines are a key component of an emerging `information standard <http://biotoolsschema.readthedocs.io/en/latest/information_requirement.html>`_ for tools being adopted by bio.tools, as a basis to monitor content and label bio.tools entries.

   - **automatically verified** guidelines are (or will be) checked *via* automated periodic QC of the bio.tools system
   - **manually verified** guidelines are checked *via* manual QC performed by trusted curators (bio.tools admin, entry owners *etc.*)
   - advice given in boxes (notes, tips, caution *etc.* are not verified


     
General guidelines
------------------

Before you start
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Consider the following *before* creating a bio.tools entry:

1. **Are one or more entries required to describe the software?**

   - `workbenches <http://biotools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/curators_guide.html#workbench>`_ and other `suites <http://biotools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/curators_guide.html#suite>`_ often require multiple entries.
   - tools with multiple interfaces (*e.g.* `Command-line tool <http://biotools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/curators_guide.html#command-line-tool>`_ , `Web API <http://biotools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/curators_guide.html#web-api>`_, `Web service <http://biotools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/curators_guide.html#web-service>`_ and `Web application <http://biotools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/curators_guide.html#web-application>`_) **SHOULD** be described by a single entry **unless** these interfaces provide fundamental functional differences (see `Tool functions <http://biotools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/curators_guide.html#id7>`_ below).
   - if in doubt, mail `registry-support <mailto:registry-support@elixir-dk.org>`_.

2. **What tool types apply?**

   - one or more tool `types <http://biotools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/curators_guide.html#tool-type>`_ may be assigned in a single entry reflecting different facets of the software described by the entry.
   - read the tool type-specific `guidelines <http://biotools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/curators_guide.html#guidelines-per-tool-type>`_ before you create the tool.

     
3. **What if the software is already registered?** 

   - if you're the rightful owner of the entry (*i.e.* the tool developer or provider of an online service) then request ownership of it
   - otherwise, request edit rights 

   Make these requests using the buttons at the bottom of the Tool Card (see *e.g.* https://bio.tools/signalp).

   If you plan to register multiple entries *en masse*, please discuss this first with `bio.tools admin <mailto:registry-support@elixir-dk.org>`_.  
     
4. **Are there version-specific considerations?**

   - as a rule, a bio.tools entry **SHOULD** describe the *latest version* available at the time of registration and **SHOULD** be updated, as required, for subsequent releases.
   - if a new version has fundamental functional differences (see `Tool functions <http://biotools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/curators_guide.html#id7>`_ below) it **MAY** be registered as an entirely new entry.  In such cases, follow carefully the guidelines for tool `name <http://biotools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/curators_guide.html#name>`_ and `version <http://biotools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/curators_guide.html#version>`_ annotations.

5. **Plan** how to describe the `tool functions <http://biotools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/curators_guide.html#tool-functions>`_.
6. **Read** the general `EDAM annotations guidelines <http://biotools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/curators_guide.html#edam-annotation-guidelines>`_.

Tool functions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
bio.tools uses a model of software (see below) defined within `biotoolsSchema <https://github.com/bio-tools/biotoolsschema>`_.  A tool can have one or more basic functions (modes of operation), each function performing one or more specific operation (e.g."Sequence alignment"), each of which may have one or more primary inputs and outputs, each of a defined type of data and listing supported format(s).

  
.. image:: tool_function.PNG

Plan how how to describe the software:

- identify the distinct functions (modes of operation) and the individual operations associated with each one.  Typically different functions (modes) perform different operations and for well documented tools, this is usually obvious.  If in any doubt mail `registry-support <mailto:registry-support@elixir-dk.org>`_.
- as a general rule, if the tool allows an option between doing one thing or another, then you **MUST** annotate the operations as distinct functions.  If in contrast a tool always does one or more things, then you **MUST** annotate these as distinct operations within a single function.
- bio.tools aims for fairly coarse-grained description, *i.e.* you **SHOULD** only specify the primary functions and operations, from a typical end-user perspective.  If a tool happens to perform some operation internally, but this is secondary to its advertised purpose, then you **SHOULD NOT** annotate it.  If in doubt mail `registry-support <mailto:registry-support@elixir-dk.org>`_
- this holds for input and output too, *e.g.* a sequence alignment tool would be annotated as reading sequences (input), and writing a sequence alignment (output), but not with gap insertion and extension penalties, or other parameters.
- many tools allow a primary input or output to be specified in a number of alternative ways, *e.g.* a sequence input that may be specified *via* a sequence identifier, or as a literal sequence.  In such cases, you **MAY** annotate the alternatives as distinct functions (see above).  If specifying just one alternative, you **SHOULD** use the EDAM Data concept for the type of data, rather than identifier.  

.. note::
   A future refactoring may improve the modelling for alternative specification of inputs and outputs, by allowing multiple data+format couplets for a given input or output.  If this is done, the proposed guideline would be: 

   - you **MAY** annotate all the commonly used alternatives and, if specifying alternatives, **MUST** annotate these as distinct data + format couplets within a single input or output.
   - many inputs and outputs are complex, with individual data files containining multiple types of data.  You **MUST** select the single EDAM Data term that best describes an input or output (see `EDAM annotations <http://biotools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/curators_guide.html#edam-annotations>`_ below) and **MUST NOT** specify multiple EDAM Data terms describing differents facets of the data.

   Input on this issue is welcomed via `GitHub <https://github.com/bio-tools/biotoolsSchema/issues/83>`_.

EDAM annotations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The `EDAM ontology <http://edamontologydocs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ is used to annotate applicable `topics <http://biotools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/curators_guide.html#topic>`_, `operations <http://biotools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/curators_guide.html#operation>`_, and the `type <http://biotools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/curators_guide.html#data-type-input-and-output-data>`_ and `format <http://biotools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/curators_guide.html#data-format-input-and-output-data>`_ of inputs and outputs. The general guidelines below apply for all EDAM annotations.

- **1.** **MUST NOT** use "organisational" EDAM concepts *e.g.* Topic of "Topic" or Operation of "Operation" (see note below)
- **2.** **SHOULD** use the most specific term(s) available, bearing in mind some concepts are necessarily overlapping or general.  If multiple sibling terms are applicable (*i.e.* terms under a common parent), the parent term may be applicable.
- **3.** **SHOULD NOT** use both a term and it's parent or other ancestor, when annotating a single attribute.  An exception would be a tool which *e.g.* performs some general `Sequence analysis <http://edamontology.org/operation_2403>`_ operations but specialises on `Protein feature detection <http://edamontology.org/operation_3092>`_.

.. tip::
   If you're struggling to find the terms you need, or the meaning of a term is not obvious, search EDAM using the browsers below (they have different functionalities).  Multiple searches using synonyms, alternative spellings *etc.* can help.

   - `EBI OLS browser <http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols/ontologies/edam>`_
   - `NCBO BioPortal browser <https://bioportal.bioontology.org/ontologies/EDAM>`_
   - `EDAM ontology browser from IFB <https://ifb-elixirfr.github.io/edam-browser/>`_
   - `EDAM Tool Annotator Demo <http://people.binf.ku.dk/vzn529/eta/>`_
   

   If you cannot find the right term, request it’s added to EDAM via `GitHub <https://github.com/edamontology/edamontology/issues/new>`_ but first read the guidelines on `how to request a term <http://edamontologydocs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contributors_guide.html#requests>`_.
     
.. note::
   It currently takes some time from requesting new EDAM terms for these to be supported in bio.tools.  In future, you'll be able to request terms directly via the bio.tools registration interface and these terms will become immediately available for use, albeit subject to approval and possible change before inclusion in EDAM and bio.tools.

.. note::
   Some high-level "organisational" concepts defined in EDAM are intended primarily to structure the hierarchy, and are not intended for annotation in bio.tools. They are defined in `EDAM.owl <https://github.com/edamontology/edamontology/blob/master/EDAM_dev.owl>`_ via ``<usageGuideline>Not recommended for annotation in bio.tools.</usageGuideline>`.  Such tips are visible in the OLS and BioPortal browsers.
      
   

Attribute guidelines
--------------------

.. attention::
Guidelines below are organised into sections as they appear in the `bio.tools <https://bio.tools>`_ registration user interface
 
Summary group
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
*Basic information about the software.*

Name
....
*Canonical software name assigned by the software developer or service provider, e.g. "needle"*

- **1.** **MUST** use name in common use, *e.g.* in the tool homepage and publication.
- **2.** **MUST** use short form if available *e.g.* ``ExPASy`` **not** ``ExPASy Bioinformatics Resource Portal``.
- **3.** **MUST NOT** include general or technical terms ("software", "application", "server", "service", "SOAP", "REST", "RESTful" *etc.*) *unless* these are part of the common name
- **4.** **MUST NOT** misappropriate the names of other tools, *e.g.* there are many online BLAST services besides the original NCBI BLAST tool; calling any of them "BLAST" would be wrong
- **5.** **MUST NOT** include version information *unless* this is part of common name
- **6.** **SHOULD** preserve capitalisation *e.g.* ``ExPASy`` **not** ``expasy``.
- **7.** **SHOULD** follow the naming patterns (see below)

.. note::
   - see the `syntax guidelines <http://biotools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api_attribute_model_dev.html#name>`_.
  
.. note::  **Naming patterns**

   For `database portals <http://biotools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/curators_guide.html#database-portal>`_ use the pattern:

     ``name (acronym)`` *e.g.* ``The Protein Databank (PDB)``

   - a common abbreviation can be given instead of an acronym
   - if no common acronym or abbreviation exists, omit this part: do not invent one!
     
   For tools that simply wrap or provide an interface to some other tool, including `Web APIs <http://biotools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/curators_guide.html#id125>`_ (REST), `Web services <http://biotools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/curators_guide.html#id133>`_ (SOAP+WSDL), and `web applications <http://biotools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/curators_guide.html#id123>`_ over command-line tools, use the pattern:

     ``{collectionName} toolName {API|WS}{( providerName)}`` *e.g.* ``EMBOSS water API (ebi)``

   where:
  
   * ``collectionName`` is the name of suite, workbench or other collection the underlying tool is from (if applicable)
   * ``toolName`` is the `canonical name <http://biotools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/curators_guide.html#id17>`_ of the underlying tool
   * use ``API`` for Web APIs or ``WS`` for Web services
   * ``providerName`` is the name of the institute providing the online service (if applicable)

   If in exceptional cases (*i.e.* when registering, as separate entries, `versions <http://biotools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/curators_guide.html#tool-versions>`_ of a tool with `fundamental differences <http://biotools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/curators_guide.html#before-you-start>`_), substitute for ``toolName`` in the pattern above:
   
     ``toolname versionID`` *e.g.* ``FindPeaks 3.1``

   where ``versionID`` is the version number.
   
.. tip::
   - in case of mulitple related entries be consistent, *e.g.* ``Open PHACTS`` and ``Open PHACTS API``
   - be wary of names that are very long (>25 characters). If shortening the name is necessary, don't truncate it in a way (*e.g.* within the middle of a word) that would render it meaningless or unintuitive

     

Description
...........
*Textual description of the software, e.g. "needle reads two input sequences and writes their optimal global sequence alignment to file. It uses the Needleman-Wunsch alignment algorithm to find the optimum alignment (including gaps) of two sequences along their entire length. The algorithm uses a dynamic programming method to ensure the alignment is optimum, by exploring all possible alignments and choosing the best."*

- **1.** **MUST** provide a concise summary of purpose / function of the tool
- **2.** **MUST** begin with a capital letter and end with a period ('.') 
- **4.** **SHOULD NOT** include any of the following, *unless* essential to distinguish the tool from other bio.tool entries:

  - general or technical terms ("software", "application", "server", "service", "SOAP", "REST", "RESTful" *etc.*) 
  - provenance information *e.g.* software provider, institute or person name

- **5.** **SHOULD NOT** describe how good the software is (mentions of applicability are OK)
- **6.** **SHOULD NOT** include URLs

.. note::
   - see the `syntax guidelines <http://biotools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api_attribute_model_dev.html#description>`_.
  

Homepage
........
*Homepage of the software, or some URL that best serves this purpose, e.g. "http://emboss.open-bio.org/rel/rel6/apps/needle.html"*

- **1.** **MUST** resolve to a web page from the developer / provider that most specifically describes the tool

.. note::
   - see the `syntax guidelines <http://biotools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api_attribute_model_dev.html#homepage>`_.  
  
.. tip:: In case a tool lacks it's own website, a URL of it's code repository is OK. Do not use a general URL such as an institutional homepage, unless nothing better is available.



Version
.......
*Version information (typically a version number) of the software applicable to this bio.tools entry, e.g. "6.4.0.0"*

- **1.** **MUST** correctly identify the tool version as described by the other attributes (see note below)
- **2.** **MUST** specify exactly the public version label in common use
- **3.** **MUST NOT** include tokens such as "v", "ver", "version", "rel", "release" *etc.*, *unless* these are part of the public version label
- **4.** **MAY** identify all tool versions which are applicable to the entry
- **5.** **MAY** specify a version for database portals and web applications, but only if this is used in the common `name <http://biotools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/curators_guide.html#name>`_

.. note::
   - see the `syntax guidelines <http://biotools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api_attribute_model_dev.html#version>`_.  

.. important::
   Care is needed to ensure annotations correspond to the indicated tool version.
     - **only** change the version if you're sure there's no fundamental change to the specified tool `functions <http://biotools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/curators_guide.html#function>`_ (operations, inputs and outputs)
     - if there are fundamental changes, update the tool `function <http://biotools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/curators_guide.html#function>`_ annotation
     - **do not** assume version "1" in case the version number is not readily findable

.. tip::
   One or more version fields may be specified, and each - in princple - allows flexible specification of version information including single versions, ranges, lists and lists including ranges, *e.g.*:

   - 1.1
   - beta01
   - 2.0 - 2.7
   - 1.1, 1.2.1, 1.4, v5
   - 1.1 - 1.4, 2.0-alpha, 2.0-beta-01 - 2.0-beta-04, 2.0.0
   - *etc.*

   We recommend to keep things simple (one version label per field by default) and pragmatic (using version ranges where desirable).
       

Other IDs
.........
*A unique identifier of the software, typically assigned by an ID-assignment authority other than bio.tools, e.g. "RRID:SCR_015644"*

- **1.** **MUST** correctly identify the same tool as indicated by the `biotoolsID <http://biotools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/curators_guide.html#biotoolsid>`_
- **2.** **MUST** include version information if IDs for multiple different versions are specified
- **3.** **MAY** specify the type of identifier (see below)

.. csv-table::
   :header: "Maturity", "Description"
   :widths: 25, 100

   "doi", "Digital Object Identifier of the software assigned (typically) by the software developer or service provider."
   "rrid", "Research Resource Identifier as used by the NIH-supported Resource Identification Portal (https://scicrunch.org/resources)."
   "cpe", "Common Platform Enumeration (CPE) identifier as listed in the CPE dictionary (https://cpe.mitre.org/dictionary/)."
   "biotoolsCURIE", "bio.tools CURIE (secondary identifier)."
   
.. note::
   - see the `syntax guidelines <http://biotools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api_attribute_model_dev.html#other-ids>`_.

Value
~~~~~
*Value of tool identifier, e.g. "RRID:SCR_001156"*

- **1.** **MUST** specify a valid identifier for the tool.

Type
~~~~
*Type of tool identifier, e.g. "rrid"*

- **1.** **MAY** specify the applicable type, in terms from a controlled vocabulary (see below) - although this should not normally be necessary

Version
~~~~~~~
*Version information (typically a version number) of the software applicable to this identifier, e.g. "1.4"*

- **1.** **MUST** correctly identify the applicable tool version 
- **2.** **MUST** follow the general guidelines for `version <http://biotools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/curators_guide.html#id22>`_


Function group
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
*Details of a function (i.e. mode of operation) the software provides, expressed in concepts from the EDAM ontology.*

Operation
.........
*The basic operation(s) performed by this software function (EDAM Operation), e.g. "'Protein signal peptide detection' (http://edamontology.org/operation_0418)"*

- **1.** **MUST** correctly specify operations performed by the tool, or (if `version <http://biotools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/curators_guide.html#tool-versions>`_ is indicated), those specific version(s) of the tool
- **2.** **MUST** be correctly organised into multiple functions, in case the tool has multiple modes of operation (see guidelines for `tool functions <http://biotools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/curators_guide.html#id9>`_).
- **3.** **SHOULD** describe all the primary operations performed by that tool and **SHOULD NOT** describe secondary / minor operations: if in any doubt, mail `registry-support <mailto:registry-support@elixir-dk.org>`_. 

.. attention::
   - see the `general guidelines for EDAM annotations <http://biotools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/curators_guide.html#id13>`_.

.. note::
   - see the `syntax guidelines <http://biotools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api_attribute_model_dev.html#operation>`_.
     
  
     
Data type (input and output data)
.................................
*Type of primary input / output data (if any) e.g. "'Sequence' (http://edamontology.org/data_2044)"*

- **1.** **MUST** correctly specify types of input or output data processed by the tool, or (if `version <http://biotools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/curators_guide.html#tool-versions>`_ is indicated), those specific version(s) of the tool
- **2.** **MUST** be correctly associated with the operation(s); for each function in case the tool has multiple modes of operation (see guidelines for `tool functions <http://biotools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/curators_guide.html#id9>`_).
- **3.** **SHOULD** describe all the primary inputs and outputs of the tool and **SHOULD NOT** describe secondary / minor inputs and outputs: if in any doubt, mail `registry-support <mailto:registry-support@elixir-dk.org>`_. 

.. attention::
   - see the `general guidelines for EDAM annotations <http://biotools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/curators_guide.html#id13>`_.

.. tip::
   - many tools allow a primary input to be specified in a number of alternative ways, the common case being a sequence input that may be specified via a sequence identifier, or by typing in a literal sequence.  In such cases, annotate the input using the EDAM Data concept for the type of data, not the identifier.

.. note::
   - see the syntax guidelines for `input <http://biotools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api_attribute_model_dev.html#input>`_ and `output <http://biotools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api_attribute_model_dev.html#output>`_
  

     
     
Data format (input and output data)
...................................
*Allowed format(s) of primary inputs/outputs e.g. "'FASTA' (http://edamontology.org/format_1929)"*

- **1.** **MUST** correctly specify data formats supported on input or output by the tool, or (if `version <http://biotools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/curators_guide.html#tool-versions>`_) is indicated, those specific version(s) of the tool
- **2.** **MUST** be correctly associated with the data type of an input or output (see guidelines for `tool functions <http://biotools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/curators_guide.html#id9>`_).
- **3.** **SHOULD** describe the primary data formats and **MAY** exhaustively describe *all* formats: if in any doubt, mail `registry-support <mailto:registry-support@elixir-dk.org>`_. 

.. attention:: see the `general guidelines for EDAM annotations <http://biotools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/curators_guide.html#id13>`_.

.. note::
   - see the `syntax guidelines <http://biotools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api_attribute_model_dev.html#format>`_.
       
    
Note
.......
*Concise comment about this function, if not apparent from the software description and EDAM annotations, e.g. "This option is slower, but more precise.*"

- **1.** **MUST** not duplicate what is already apparent from the EDAM annotations
- **2.** **SHOULD** be concise and summarise only critical usage information
- **3.** **SHOULD NOT** duplicate online documentation; give a link if necessary

.. note::
   - see the `syntax guidelines <http://biotools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api_attribute_model_dev.html#operation>`_.

Tool type guidelines
--------------------

Command-line tool
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
**A tool with a text-based (command-line) interface.**

- carefully identify the major functions (modes of operation) performed by the tool (see `Tool functions <http://biotools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/curators_guide.html#id7>`_) and annotate the major `operation(s) <http://biotools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/curators_guide.html#operation>`_ associated with each function, in turn.
  

Database portal
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
**A Web application, suite or workbench providing a portal to a biological database.**

- pick one or more `topics <http://biotools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/curators_guide.html#topic>`_ that best describe the database content. See also the specialised `Data management <http://edamontology.org/topic_3071>`_ concepts.
- consider carefully whether the database portal will be described by a single, or more than one bio.tools entry (see `Before you start <http://biotools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/curators_guide.html#before-you-start>`_).  In case the portal contains one or more discrete tools (web applications), it is recommended to register these as separate entries.
- consider an operation of `Database search <http://edamontology.org/operation_2421>`_ (or its children)

Desktop application
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
**A tool with a graphical user interface that runs on your desktop environment, e.g. on a PC or mobile device.**

- desktop applications often have complex functionality: carefully identify the major functions (modes of operation) performed by the application (see `Tool functions <http://biotools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/curators_guide.html#id7>`_) and annotate the major `operation(s) <http://biotools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/curators_guide.html#operation>`_ associated with each function, in turn.
- consider an operation of `Visualisation <http://edamontology.org/operation_0337>`_ (or its children) - typical of desktop apps.
  
Library
^^^^^^^
**A collection of components that are used to construct other tools. bio.tools scope includes component libraries performing high-level bioinformatics functions but excludes lower-level programming libraries.**

- in case the library includes just a few components, each should (typically) be modelled as a distinct function (see `Tool functions <http://biotools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/curators_guide.html#id7>`_); annotate the major `operation(s) <http://biotools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/curators_guide.html#operation>`_ associated with each component (function) in turn.
- in case the library includes very many components, model the whole library as having a single function (see `Tool functions <http://biotools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/curators_guide.html#id7>`_); and annotate only the major `operation(s) <http://biotools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/curators_guide.html#operation>`_ (do not try to be exhaustive).
  
Ontology
^^^^^^^^
**A collection of information about concepts, including terms, synonyms, descriptions etc.**

- pick `Ontology and terminology <http://edamontology.org/topic_0089>`_ and one or more most relevant `topics <http://biotools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/curators_guide.html#topic>`_ describing the scope of the ontology.
  
- do not annotate the function (operations, or type / format of the input and output data)
  
Plug-in
^^^^^^^
**A software component encapsulating a set of related functions, which are not standalone, *i.e.* depend upon other software for its use, e.g. a Javascript widget, or a plug-in, extension add-on etc. that extends the function of some existing tool.**

- when annotating the plug-in `function(s) <http://biotools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/curators_guide.html#id7>`_, be careful to not duplicate the description of the tool which plug-in plugs into
- carefully identify the major new functions (modes of operation) which the plug-in provides, and annotate the major `operation(s) <http://biotools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/curators_guide.html#operation>`_ associated with each function, in turn.
  
Script
^^^^^^
**A tool written for some run-time environment (e.g. other applications or an OS shell) that automates the execution of tasks. Often a small program written in a general-purpose languages (e.g. Perl, Python) or some domain-specific languages (e.g. sed).**

- scripts typically have a single function (mode of operation) (see `Tool functions <http://biotools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/curators_guide.html#id7>`_), however, in case of complex scripts, carefully identify the major functions (modes of operation) performed by the script, and annotate the major `operation(s) <http://biotools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/curators_guide.html#operation>`_ associated with each function, in turn.
  
- pick one or more most relevant `topics <http://biotools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/curators_guide.html#topic>`_
  
SPARQL endpoint
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
**A service that provides queries over an RDF knowledge base via the SPARQL query language and protocol, and returns results via HTTP.**

- pick the `operation <http://biotools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/curators_guide.html#operation>`_ of "Query and retrieval" (http://edamontology.org/operation_0224)
- do not annotate the type or format of the input and output data

Suite
^^^^^
**A collection of tools which are bundled together into a convenient toolkit. Such tools typically share related functionality, a common user interface and can exchange data conveniently. This includes collections of stand-alone command-line tools, or Web applications within a common portal.**

- pick one or more most relevant `topics <http://biotools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/curators_guide.html#topic>`_ that describe the workbench as a whole (don't try to be exhaustive)
  
- describe the attributes that are commmon to the suite as a whole, not (typically) attributes of individual tools
- individual tools included in the suite should be registered as separate entries
- when annotating the `operation <http://biotools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/curators_guide.html#operation>`_ of the suite, select operations that are core function of the suite itself / common to all tools in the suite.  Alternatively pick one or two of the primary operation(s) of the included tools
- entries for the suite itself and it's component tools can be associated by annotatong them as part of a common `collection <http://biotools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/curators_guide.html#collection>`_

.. tip:: If you are considering to register a suite with many tools, it is a good idea to discuss this first with the `bio.tools admin <mailto:registry-support@elixir-dk.org>`_.
	 
.. attention:: **do not** annotate the `type <http://biotools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/curators_guide.html#data-type-input-and-output-data>`_ and `format <>`_ of input and output data, *unless* all tools in the suite happen to have these in common

Web application
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
**A tool with a graphical user interface that runs in your Web browser.**

- pick one or more most relevant `topics <http://biotools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/curators_guide.html#topic>`_

.. note::
   - for software that essentially just wraps or provides an interface to some other tool, *e.g.* a web application or web service over an existing tool, use the pattern ``toolName providerName`` where ``providerName`` is a name (without spaces) of some institute, workbench, collection *etc.*, *e.g.* ``cufflinks cloudIFB``.  **Do not** misappropriate the original name!     

     
Web API
^^^^^^^
**An application programming interface (API) consisting of endpoints to a request-response message system accessible via HTTP. Includes everything from simple data-access URLs to RESTful APIs.**

- pick one or more most relevant `topics <http://biotools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/curators_guide.html#topic>`_

- in general, describe the attributes of the API as a whole, not individual endpoint of the API (see note below)
- in case the API has a single endpoint only, the input(s), operation(s) and output(s) may be annotated
- in case the API has many endpoints, annotate the primary operation(s), but **not** the inputs and outputs
- annotate the location of machine-readable API specification (*e.g.* openAPI file) using the `download <http://biotools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/curators_guide.html#download>`_ attribute with `download type <http://biotools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/curators_guide.html#download-type>`_ of ``API specification``
  - annotate the location of any human-readable documentation using the `documentation <http://biotools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/curators_guide.html#documentation>`_ attribute with `documentation type <http://biotools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/curators_guide.html#download-type>`_ of ``API specification``
- when assigning the `name <http://biotools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/curators_guide.html#name>`_, use the pattern ``name API`` *e.g.* ``Open PHACTS API``
- in case the web service provides an interface to an existing tool registered in bio.tools, try to ensure the relevant annotations are consistent

.. note::
   - `biotoolsSchema <https://github.com/bio-tools/biotoolsschema>`_ includes a basic model of an API specification including endpoints however this is not yet supported in bio.tools

     
Web service
^^^^^^^^^^^
**An API described in a machine readable form (typically WSDL) providing programmatic access via SOAP over HTTP.**

- pick one or more most relevant `topics <http://biotools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/curators_guide.html#topic>`_

  
- in general, describe the attributes of the web service as a whole, not individual endpoint of the service (see note below)
- in case the web service has a single endpoint only, the input(s), operation(s) and output(s) may be annotated
- in case the web service has many endpoints, annotate the primary operation(s), but **not** the inputs and outputs
- annotate the location of the WSDL file using the `download <http://biotools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/curators_guide.html#download>`_ attribute with `download type <http://biotools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/curators_guide.html#download-type>`_ of ``API specification``
- annotate the location of any human-readable documentation using the `documentation <http://biotools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/curators_guide.html#documentation>`_ attribute with `documentation type <http://biotools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/curators_guide.html#download-type>`_ of ``API specification``
- when assigning the `name <http://biotools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/curators_guide.html#name>`_, use the pattern ``name WS`` *e.g.* ``EMMA WS``
- in case the web service provides an interface to an existing tool registered in bio.tools, try to ensure the relevant annotations are consistent

.. note::
   - `biotoolsSchema <https://github.com/bio-tools/biotoolsschema>`_ includes a basic model of an API specification including endpoints however this is not yet supported in bio.tools


Workbench
^^^^^^^^^
**An application or suite with a graphical user interface, providing an integrated environment for data analysis which includes or may be extended with any number of functions or tools. Includes workflow systems, platforms, frameworks etc.**

- pick one or more most relevant `topics <http://biotools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/curators_guide.html#topic>`_ that best describe the workbench as a whole (don't try to be exhaustive)
  
- describe the attributes of the workbench as a whole, not (typically) individual tools or functions provided by it
- individual tools included in the workbench, especially where these tools are indepepdently available, should be registered as separate entries
- individual functions provided by the workbench, especially where these are not independently available, should each be described in their own `function <http://biotools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/curators_guide.html#function>`_
- entries for the workbench itself and it's component tools can be associated by annotatong them as part of a common `collection <http://biotools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/curators_guide.html#collection>`_

.. tip:: If you are considering to register a complicated workbench with many tools or functions, it is a good idea to discuss this first with the `bio.tools admin <mailto:registry-support@elixir-dk.org>`_.
	 

Workflow
^^^^^^^^
**A set of tools which have been composed together into a pipeline of some sort. Such tools are (typically) standalone, but are composed for convenience, for instance for batch execution via some workflow engine or script.**

- pick one or more most relevant `topics <http://biotools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/curators_guide.html#topic>`_ that best describe the workflow as a whole (don't try to be exhaustive)
  
- when deciding how to annotate a workflow inputs, operations and outputs, consider the worfklow as a "black box" , *i.e.* annotate the input(s) to, output(s) from and primary operation(s) of the workflow as a whole
  
.. note::
   - `bio.tools <https://bio.tools>`_ does not currently contain many examples of workflows.  We welcome input on how to describe worfklows and ensure good coverage:  please `get in touch with us <mailto:registry@elixir-dk.org>`_.


.. important:: workflows can contain many tools; **do not** list all the operations performed by these tools, just the main operation(s) of the workflow as a whole.


Further guidelines (bio.tools admin only)
-----------------------------------------
.. attention::
   The guidelines that follow are for attributes and other aspects under the control of bio.tools admin.  If you're not a bio.tools admin you can ignore this section.

biotoolsID
^^^^^^^^^^

*Unique ID (case insensitive) of the tool that is assigned upon registration of the software in bio.tools, normally identical to tool name, e.g. "needle".*

.. attention::
   - the ID by default is a URL-safe version of the tool name, and is set (and can only be changed) by bio.tools admin.  

- **MUST** use the default value where possible
- **MUST** be clean and intuitive (in case use of default is not possible) 
- **MUST NOT** truncate the name (in the middle of a word, or at all) if this renders the ID ugly or meaningless

.. note::
   **Transformation rules**
   
   The following rules apply when transforming the supplied tool name:

   - replace ' ' (spaces) in the name with underscores (a single underscore in case of multiple spaces)
   - preserve all reserved characters (uppercase and lowercase letters, decimal digits, hyphen, period, underscore, and tilde), but remove other characters
   - use '_' to delimit parts of names but only *if* these are not already truncated in the original `name <http://biotools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/curators_guide.html#id123>`_
   - adhere to the same patterns for `tool name <http://biotools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/curators_guide.html#name>`_, *e.g.* ``EMBOSS_water_API_ebi``

     
biotoolsCURIE
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
*bio.tools CURIE (compact URI) based on the unique bio.tools ID of the tool, e.g. "biotools:needle"*
     
.. note::

   - identical to biotoolsID but with the prefix ``biotools:``
