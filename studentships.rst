bio.tools Studentships
======================

`ELIXIR Denmark <http://elixir-node.cbs.dtu.dk/>`_ - the coordinating node of the bio.tools project - has earmarked funds to support studentships to work on curation-focussed mini-projects for bio.tools.  Projects must have clear and quantifiable impact on bio.tools content, in terms of number of entries and / or content quality.  Projects can include developments of some tooling, so long as this contributes directly to the project goals.

If you would like to propose a project, then please discuss your ideas first by mailiing `Jon Ison <mailto:jison@cbs.dtu.dk>`_ cc `Peter Longreen <mailto:peterl@cbs.dtu.dk>`_ and `Henriette Husum Bak-Jensen <mailto:hhu@bio.ku.dk>`_.  If following this discussion, we all agree there is basis for a project, then we'd require a 1-page project proposal, the text of which we can work on together and in collaboration with other memebers of the `registry-core <http://biotools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/governance.html#registry-core>`_ group.  Funding will be prioritised (by Jon, Peter and Henriette) for proposals having the biggest potential impact on bio.tools content and quality. 

We anticipate most projects to be short duration (normally the equivalent of a month full time work) however there is flexibility, especially where we find talented students who can clearly demonstrate that there work has made an impact.  In case of project continuation, progress would be reviewed, and funding for projects that did not perform would be terminated.

------------
Requirements
------------
- each proposal requires (at least) two named mentors:  

  - someone to vouch for the student, provide local on-site supervision, and handle payment of the student
  - someone (normally from the the `registry-core <http://biotools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/governance.html#registry-core>`_ group) who will assist with supervision and oversee the delivery of the work

- students must be enrolled with an accedited University, or have accepted a place at such
- any tooling developed during the studentship would have to made freely available under open license.

Answers to FAQ
--------------
- you are welcome to apply at any time 
- there is no limit to the number of proposals, although a student can only be employed on one project at one time
- you cannot participate both as a mentor and a student
- only an individual may work on a project; groups cannot submit proposals
- when writing a proposal, please refer to the existing `proposals <http://biotools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/studentships.html#proposals>`_ below and follow the general structure and style
- projects must have clear and quantifiable impact on bio.tools content, but you are free to propose anything to these ends: you will need to inspect https://bio.tools and https://dev.bio.tools (latest dev server) to assess current status
