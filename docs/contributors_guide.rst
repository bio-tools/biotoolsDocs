Contributors Guide
==================

bio.tools community site
------------------------
**GitHub** is used for sharing code and data for all *bio.tools*-related projects:

- https://github.com/bio-tools/
- https://github.com/bio-tools/biotoolsschema
- https://github.com/bio-tools/biotoolsregistry
- https://github.com/edamontology/edamontology

Feature requests & issues
-------------------------
GitHub is used to track **fine-grained issues** and is the preferred way to make *bio.tools* feature requests, content suggestions, EDAM term requests, and bug reports:

- https://github.com/bio-tools/biotoolsregistry/issues
- https://github.com/bio-tools/biotoolsschema/issues
- https://github.com/edamontology/edamontology/issues

.. note:: GitHub is the primary means for technical coordination: collaborators are encouraged to browse tasks, review priorities, make comments and add new tasks.  

Hangouts
--------
`Coordination meetings <http://biotools.readthedocs.org/en/latest/hangouts.html>`_ are organised as required. The hangouts usually have an open agenda and respond to current critical needs.  Technical representatives of ELIXIR-DK institutes routinely attend and everyone is very welcome: if you'd like to join  `email us <mailto:help@bio.tools>`_.  

 
Editing tool descriptions
-------------------------
You can contribute to *bio.tools* directly:

- register your own (or other people's) tools
- request edit rights (via a button on the *bio.tools* Tool Cards) on entries where tools are already registered 
- request ownership (again via a button) of entries, if you are the developer of the tool described but it has been registerd by someone else
- ask for help via the email, especially in case you have many tools to add or edits to make


bio.tools benefits from the support of ELIXIR Nodes: collections of research institutes from a member country that provide the resources and services that are part of ELIXIR.
