Notes
^^^^^^^^^^^

  The “Tools, Workflows and Workbenches” hackathon (Institut Pasteur, May 18-20) was co-organized by the French and Danish ELIXIR nodes.  The event brought together over 40 representatives from 21 academic institutions and companies, with projects including Galaxy, bio.tools, Common Workflow Language, biotoolsXSD, EDAM, Debian Med, BioShadock and more.  The delegates enjoyed a series of talks, lively discussions and breakout hacking sessions including bio.tools entry relationships, Galaxy to bio.tools publishing, CWL specification, workflow specification interoperability, and training workflows.  In addition to concrete outcomes including various technical documents, new CWL bindings and enabling support for EDAM annotations in Galaxy, the hackathon provided a boost to various ongoing collaborations between the projects and institutes.  We look forward to a re-run soon!
