Governance
==========
*bio.tools* follows a simple governance model of three tiers under the leadership of the 
`Danish ELIXIR node <http://elixir-denmark.org>`_ which is providing long-term funding and support for *bio.tools*.  Development on the ground is led by Danish Node staff in close collaboration with the registry-dev group and `EDAM developers <https://github.com/edamontology/edamontology#governance-of-edam>`_.  

If youâ€™d like to get involved with the project please mail support-bio-tools@sdu.dk.

registry-dev
-------------
registry-dev includes the technical and scientific experts at the heart of the development and curation of *bio.tools*.  Priorities are set in a quasi-democratic way; *bio.tools* is a "do-ocroacy" with the Danish ELIXIR Node staff having the final say, where necessary (in so far as this is meaningful).  registry-dev members are either funded, or have the intent and some bandwidth, to support *bio.tools* in the long-term.  Danish Node staff ensure the registry-dev group and all Contributors are listened to and informed.

`Members of registry-dev <http://biotools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contributors.html#registry-dev>`_ are responsible for agreeing aims and general good practice.  They are expected to advocate *bio.tools* and (as bandwidth allows) collaborate with one another to help develop the registry software, related technical projects and registry content, *e.g.*:

- add new and improve existing content through collaboration with EDAM Developers
- routine content maintenance including quality control
- work collaboratively within the Curation Task Force (see below) and attend Hackathons
- suggest or implement new features
- develop software for the registry and related technical projects
- evaluate the registry and provide feedback, to ensure the registry software is fit for purpose

Danish Node staff are responsible for reporting software development and curation priorities, and progress, to the ELIXIR-DK Management.

registry-dev will assemble virtually or in person as circumstances dictate, in meetings with open agenda and followed up with actions and notes on key recommendations.

Thematic editors
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Named **thematic editors** are registry-dev members responsible for overseeing coverage and quality in specific thematic areas, *e.g.*

- evaluating existing coverage (EDAM, tools)
- driving coverage (EDAM, tools)
- liasing with community & leading workshops in their specialist area

See the `Editors Guide <http://biotools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/editors_guide.html>`_.
  
Registry contributors
---------------------
Registry contributors include anyone who makes significant contributions to the registry content or registry-related software, by whatever means, but have none of the responsibilities or expectations of registry-dev.

An important (but voluntary) role of contributors is to function in an **advisory capacity**, *i.e.* review the progress and priorities of registry-dev and advise them on their priorities and how best to achieve the current aims.  To these ends, the following actions are welcome:
- read the *bio.tools* milestones and `changelog <https://github.com/bio-tools/biotoolsRegistry/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md>`_ and provide feedback on the reported progress and priorities.
- oversee the curation and development of *bio.tools* and actively offer constructive advice based on their practical experience, requirements and expertise
- advocate *bio.tools* to colleagues 

The registry-dev group will respect this feedback and advice and reflect it in subsequent rounds of development and curation.

Registry end-users
------------------
We particularly welcome input from end-users from the life science community including scientists, technicians and managers from academia and industry:
- to test, evaluate and critique the registry software and content
- to provide feedback and constructive advice based on their practical experience, requirements and expertise

registry-dev will respect this feedback and advice and reflect it in subsequent rounds of registry development and curation.
Anyone who is considering using the registry - but especially typical scientist / bioinformatician end-users - are welcome to mail support-bio-tools@sdu.dk
