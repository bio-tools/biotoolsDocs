NOTE
----

- Things mentioned previously that will **not** be done

  - "sandbox" area for intermediate registrations.  The information requirement is now lower for `beta entries <https://github.com/bio-tools/biotoolsSchema#information-requirements>`_ , "sandbox" (staging area) is not needed
  - "moderation interface" for mass content import.  Instead there will be enhanced QA/QC with features for improving entries (see below)
  - improved admin interface for content management.  Instead an admin will be able to edit any entry via the UI, also programmatically via Python notebooks (see below)
