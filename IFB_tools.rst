IFB tools
=========

.. warning
   WORK IN PROGRESS - THESE GUIDELINES ARE CURRENTLY BEING WORKED ON / ARE IN A MESS. PLEASE COME BACK LATER.


These instructions will guide you through the steps to register your tools in `bio.tools`_ and describe them to the standard required for inclusion in the IFB Catalogue - the French national catalogue of bioinformatics resources.

.. note::
    These instructions are tailored to the needs of IFB tool providers.  If you find a bug, or have any questions or suggestions, please `mail Jon Ison <mailto:jon.c.ison@gmail.com>`_.  For general queries about bio.tools please `mail registry-support <mailto:registry-support@elixir-dk.org>`_.


    
Getting started
---------------

Create an account
"""""""""""""""""
You'll need a *bio.tools* account to create `bio.tools`_ entries or edit existing ones.  Creating an account is simple: just click on the `Sign-up` at the top-right corner of the page [sign_up|.

.. |sign_up| image:: _static/sign_up.png
   :width: 100px
   :height: 30px

You'll be asked for a username, email address and password, then your account will be setup immediately.

.. note::
   *bio.tools* entries are owned by the individuals who created them. Owners may grant edit rights, or transfer ownership of their entries to other registered users. The rightful owner of a *bio.tools* entry is usually the person who developed/provides the tool described, or some other responsible person, *e.g. a dedicated curator.

Find your tools
"""""""""""""""""
Check to see whether your tool is already registered in `bio.tools`_ by searching for the tool by its name. If you find an entry you can go ahead and update it.  If you can't find an entry, you'll need to create one.

Create an entry
"""""""""""""""
To create a new entry, you'll need to log onto *bio.tools*. Then click on *Menu ... Add content*, and follow the `instructions <https://>`_ below.

Update an entry
"""""""""""""""
To edit an existing entry, you need to bring up the Tool Card for the tool in question, *e.g.* https://bio.tools/signalp.  You'll see up to three different buttons at the bottom right of the Tool Card:

|update|

* Click on *Update this record* to edit it, following the `instructions <https://>`_ below.
* Click on *Request editing rights* if you want to get edit rights to the entry 
* Click on *Request ownership* if you want to claim ownership of the entry

It can take a little while for other users to respond to requests for edit rights or ownership.  If these are not granted within a day or two, please `mail registry-support <mailto:registry-support@elixir-dk.org>`_.

..note:: If you developed or prodive the tool described, then please claim ownership of the bio.tools entry!

Describe your tool
------------------

Tool descriptions are created or edited using the *bio.tools* registration interface, which is organised into different tabs described below.

At any moment, you can click on Save |validate_save| to save your edits, and immediately publish the changes online.  All the information you specified will be checked to ensure it's in syntax required by bio.tools. You can, optionally, force a manual validity check by clicking on Validate.

   :width: 100px
   :height: 30px



	    
.. Important::
    *bio.tools* requires at least the name, desription and homepage URL of a tool are specified.  These are marked with a red asterix |asterix| in the registration interface, and must be given before a new entry can be created.  The IFB catalogue mandates more information (see sections below).

	    
Summary
"""""""
For this first part, you specify the tool **name**, a short **description** and its **homepage URL**.

.. csv-table::
   :header: "Attribute", "Requirement", "Guidelines"
   :widths: 25, 100
      
   "Name", "Mandatory", <link https://biotools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/curators_guide.html#name-tool>_
   "Description", "Mandatory", <link https://biotools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/curators_guide.html#description>_
   "Homepage URL", "Mandatory", <link, https://biotools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/curators_guide.html#homepage>_
   "Software version(s)", "Ignore", <link, https://biotools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/curators_guide.html#version-tool>_

  .. Important::
   A `unique identifier <https://biotools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/curators_guide.html#id105>`_ for a tool (the *bio.tools* toolID) is set when a new entry is created.  The ID provides a persistent reference to the tool, used by bio.tools and other systems. It's important therefore that the ID is sensible and intuitive.

   The ID is a URL-safe version of the supplied tool name. It is **not** currently editable, so if you want the ID to differ from the name (*e.g.* a name "Protein databank (PDB)" and an ID simply of "PDB), you have to apply a workaround: 1) create the entry giving a value for "Name" which is the desired ID value.  2) Save the entry.  3) Edit the entry, resetting the name.

   To request an ID change post-registration you have to mail `Registry Support <mailto:registry-support@elixir-dk.org>`_. 


      
Function
""""""""
This is where you describe the functionality of the tool based on the `EDAM ontology`_ [1]_.
The functionality is captured in a diagram on the Tool Cards that look like this:

|biotool_function| 

In each box, you can add as many fields as you want. You can also add a general comment about the function (*this is particularly useful when your entry has several functions*).  It's highly recommended to read up about `tool functions <https://biotools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/curators_guide.html#toolfunctions>`_ before filling this section.

.. Note::
   It can be difficult to find the right terms to describe a tools operation(s), input(s) or output(s).  You can use `OLS EDAM`_, `BioPortal`_ and `EDAM Browser`_ to browse EDAM and find the terms you need, or request new terms via `GitHub <https://github.com/edamontology/edamontology/issues>`_.  Improvements (including term requests) to the term picker in *bio.tools* are planned.

Labels
""""""
In this part, you can tell more about your tool:

* What **type** of resource it is (Command-line tool, Web application *etc.*)
* Relevant **topic(s)** the tool fits with (from the `EDAM ontology`_ [1]_).
* In which **operating system** it is possible to use it.
* The **language** used to develop the tool, its **license** and **maturity**.
* The **accessibility** of your tool and its **cost**.

You can also assign your tool to an arbitrary **collection** which can be useful for grouping together related tools.

Links
"""""
It is the place where your add links that do not belong to Download or Documentation.  For instance, a link to a mailing list, mirror or repository (full list available on the drop-down menu of **Link type**).

Download
""""""""
You can here share all the different download links you want. It can be many different kind such as binaries, source code, biological data, test data *etc.* (see the **Download type** drop-down menu).

Documentation
"""""""""""""
Make your different documentations for your tool available here. Again, you can assign type of documentation using **Documentation type**.

Publications
""""""""""""
Share the different publications of the tool, which can be the primary publication (the one to cite when the tool is used), but also
reviews or secondary references (see **Publication type**). You can use either the **PubMed Central ID** (PMCID), the **PubMed ID** (PMID) or the **Digital Object ID** (DOI) - DOI is preferred.

.. _credits:

Credits & Support
"""""""""""""""""
Credits include all type of entities that contributed to the development, maintenance or provision of the resource. Credits can have an **Entity type** (Person, Institute *etc.*) and an **Entity role** (Developer, Documentor *etc.*).  Use the role of *Primary contact* to indicate preferred contact details.

.. _json:

JSON
""""
This is all the information you gave about your tool, formatted in JSON format.

Permissions
"""""""""""
You can decide to make the entry either editable only by yourself, a list of users or anyone.


Remove a resource
-----------------
From the tool card, click on update this record. Then you can remove the entry by clicking on the remove button |remove|.

.. |remove| image:: _static/remove.png
   :width: 55px
   :height: 30px

.. warning::
    Removing an entry is definitive.  There's no way back (other than emailing `Registry Support <mailto:registry-support@elixir-dk.org>`_).
