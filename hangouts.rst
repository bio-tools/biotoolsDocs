Minutes
^^^^^^^
Ad 1) 
Outreach to TESS (sifter 140, Henriette): Henriette is helping organise a workshop (Fall, 2016) between Bio.tools and TeSS on how to enable cross-links between the two ressources. 

MBG partner involvement (sifter 178, Henriette): Bernt Guldbrandsen will shortly assign a technical member to help the bio.tools expansion (wild stock and plant breeding) and to participate in our meetings.

Training platform (sifter 141, Henriette): It will be valuable to understand which E-learning ressources (online files, videos, slide decks etc) are available from the satellites. Henriette will ask this information from everyone. Hans I is willing to help make a video tutorial on 'how to load tools into Bio.tools' or 'how to get started, using COMPUTEROME'.

Anne Wenzel is in the process of loading 400 RNA-bioinformatics tools onto Bio.tools, and to adjust EDAM ontology accordingly.

Text mining tool (sifter 99, name edamMap, Veit and Jon): This project uses text mining of software descriptions/abstracts/full texts to extract associated EDAM terms. Among other applications, the results can be used for automatic tool annotation.

Workflow generation (sifter 119, Veit and Jon): EDAM provides powerful information to create pipelines for e.g. data analysis involving multiple tools. The study shows how to find applicable pipelines and presents several use cases for the analysis of mass spectrometry data. The work will be presented at ASMS 2016 (mass spectrometry conference) and a paper draft is being prepared.

EDAM Tool Annotator (sifter 46): Improved annotation of tools using EDAM terms. The tool aims to peform a "smart" term search and picking on EDAM in the effort to provide the best exisiting tool annotations; alternatively term suggestions will also be available

Tools used by ELIXIR trainers (sifter 60): finish curration for high-value tools to trainers.

Ad 2) No volunteer today. But great opportunity if needing input/bounce off idea
Ad 3) Credits to Emil for expanding the bio.tools statistics to comprise more parameters. The report could perhaps be made to contain the 'priority' dimension (Henriette and Jon to liase before the meeting, about this)
ad 4) Not done. We really should.
ad 5) Not covered, due to time pressure.
ad 6) Henriette will contact Emil about KPIs and tracking these

Minutes
^^^^^^^
Ad 1) These hangouts should have a practical focus (defined by fixed agenda items) but in-depth technical discussions should be taken elsewhere. We agreed on a set of fixed agenda items, see under 4.

Ad 2) Google hangout worked well today, and we will use this going forward.

Ad 3) All DK partners are expected to provide a representative to these meetings. Currently, we don't expect representatives from industry partners.


Ad 4) 
The fixed agenda items were agreed to be the following:
1) *TASKS* : round-robin catch-up, people say what sifterapp they're working on, asking for help on tasks, reassignment of tasks, etc.
2) *FOCUS* : one person leads a presentation and discussions on a specific point.
3) *STATUS* : people are asked to review the Status Report before the meeting and bring any points for discussion here, including points from partner institutions.
4) *PRIORITIES* : people are asked to review current priorities on sifterapp, for discussion here.
5) *EVENTS & DEADLINES* : people are asked to bring up items to be actioned -> sifter 
6) *KPI's* : Track status of key performance indicators from https://bio.tools/stats 

The fixed agenda items will enable the hangouts to serve three overall purposes
1) To surface if Elixir-DK activities are progressing as planned, and if not, what changes/resources are needed? 
2) To surface information/results (from Elixir-HUB, -events, -meetings) that need to go to the DK-partners or to the HUB. 
3) The meetings serve as a feeder for Elixir-DK Steering group meetings, and similarly, activities/decisions from the Elixir-DK Steering group can be channeled to the agenda of the hangout meetings

Today's actions were:
*Action* Henriette will contact Bernt Guldbrandsen for a representative from AU, QCG for the next meeting (ad 3)
*Action* Maria Maddalena should please send the deadlines + events weekly alert to this quorum from now on (ad 4)

Today's KPI records were:
#User accounts (affiliations) = 262
#Recurrent users = not sure (not recorded?)
#Entries = 2403
#Content changes/edits = not sure (not recorded?)
#Publications : bio.tools technical progress - ideas for future publications  - what's in progress (sifterapp)
